      the EEA.
    </p>
    <p>
      26. We will only transfer Data outside the EEA where it is compliant with
      data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate
      safeguards in relation to your data, e.g. by way of data transfer
      agreement, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted
      by the European Commission, or by signing up to the EU-US Privacy Shield
      Framework, in the event that the organisation in receipt of the Data is
      based in the United States of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      27. To ensure that your Data receives an adequate level of protection, we
      have put in place appropriate safeguards and procedures with the third
